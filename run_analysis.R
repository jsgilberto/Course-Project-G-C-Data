# run_analysis.R is an script which returns a tidy data set of all the files that are in "UCI HAR Dataset"


# WARNING: the script only works with the all the files described below in one directory:
# "subject_test.txt", "subject_train.txt", "X_test.txt", "X_train.txt", "y_test.txt", "y_train.txt", "features.txt"
# if you want to make it work in your computer be sure to make one folder and put in all the files
# mentioned above and change the variable "path" inside the function.
# The dplyr library must be added to run this script
library(dplyr)
